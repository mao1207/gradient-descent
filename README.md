# Gradient Descent

## Algorithm Principle
In solving complex optimization problems, especially non-convex functions, it is often impossible to compute the optimal point by directly computing the derivative to 0. In this case, the gradient descent method is often used instead. This project is a handwritten implementation of gradient descent to simulate the convergence of a neural network.
